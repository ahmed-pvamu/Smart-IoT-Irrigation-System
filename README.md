# Smart-IoT-Irrigation-System

This is a complete smart irrigation system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology which can be used for automating the irrigation process in agricultural fields. It is expected that this system would create a better opportunity for farmers to irrigate their fields efficiently, as well as eliminating the field's overwatering which could stress the plants. The developed system is organized into three parts: sensing side, cloud side, and user side. We used Microsoft Azure IoT Hub as an underlying infrastructure to coordinate the interaction between the three sides. First, the sensing side used a Raspberry Pi 3 device, moisture sensor, and temperature sensor to collect the current moisture, temperature, and humidity of the soil; then send the readings to the cloud side. At the cloud side, the received sensing data is fed to the irrigation scheduling algorithm which decides when and for how long the water pump should be turned on based on a user-predefined threshold. The user side was developed as an Android mobile app which can be used to control the operations of the water pump using voice recognition. Finally, we evaluated our system using various performance metrics such as latency, scalability, etc.
